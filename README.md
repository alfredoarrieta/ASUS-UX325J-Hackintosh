# OpenCore drivers and configuration file for ASUS UX325J

This repo only contains the assembled SSDTs, Kernel Extensions needed and the Configuration file. It's not finished but I decided to share it to the world.

Tested in macOS Catalina, BigSur and Monterey, currently configured for Monterey (remember to change AirportItlwm if you're using Catalina or Big Sur, also enable BluetoothInjector and disable BlueToolFixup kext)

## What works

* Camera
* Microphone
* Speakers
* Trackpad
* Brightness Fn Keys
* Volume Fn Keys
* Wifi
* Bluetooth

## What doesn't work

* Windows Hello Infrared Camera

## What needs work

* Battery Percentage is wrong
* Keyboard Brightness Fn Key
* Micro Sd reader

Any help would be appreciated!
